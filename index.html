          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            For this programming project, you are going to implement a web proxy
            server. This proxy server gets request messages from clients (web
            browsers), forwards the requests to target web server or another
            proxy server, obtains the corresponding response messages and sends
            the responses back to the clients. This proxy server should be able
            to handle all kinds of objects, not just HTML pages, but also images
            and audio files. Moreover, this proxy server should support
            persistent connections; a timeout timer should be used to terminate
            idle connection from client. To reduce the complexity of this
            programming project, the proxy server does not support caching
            mechanism.

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            HTTP is the transfer protocol used throughout the WWW. The HTTP
            protocol is a request/response protocol. When a client opens a
            connection, it immediately sends its request for a file. The web
            server then responds with the file or an error message. Each
            interaction consists of one request and one reply. Both are
            MIME-like message (MIME: The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).
            Each request message includes a request line, a few header lines, a
            blank line, and the possible message body. Similar is the response
            message.
          </p>
          <ul class="no-style">
            <li>
              Request-message = request-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
              message-body ]
            </li>
            <li>
              Response-message = status-line *(message-header CRLF) CRLF [
              message-body ]
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, below are the request/response messages sent by a web
            client (curl) to the server to download a web document:
          </p>

            Non-Persistent Connection and Persistent Connection
          </p>
          <p>
            In HTTP 1.0, after the TCP connection was established, a single
            request was sent over and a single response was sent back. Then the
            TCP connection was released. Establishing a separate connection for
            each file request incurs expensive overhead. In view of this
            deficiency, HTTP 1.1 was designed to support persistent connections.
            In HTTP 1.1, it is possible to establish a TCP connection, sends a
            request and gets a response, and then sends additional requests and
            gets additional responses. Our proxy server should support
            persistent connections between web clients and itself as well as
            between itself and target web/proxy servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an HTTP 1.1 client sends multiple requests through a single
            connection, the server should send responses back in the same order
            as the requests - this is all it takes for a server to support
            persistent connections. The server should close a connection after
            the connection has been idle for long enough duration (not defined
            in the specification; usually set to 10 - 15 seconds).

          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>
            You are going to write a simple concurrent HTTP proxy server
            (http_proxy) using C socket, which works as follows:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              The http_proxy server listens for connection requests from
              clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              When there is a new TCP connection request, the http_proxy server
              creates a new process** to handle the new connection.
            </li>
            <li>
              The new process sends any HTTP requests to the (origin/proxy)
              server and reads the server's reply.
            </li>
            <li>Then it sends the responses back to the requesting client.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            ** Instead of using multiple processes, you can implement a multiple
            threads proxy server; the http_proxy server creates one new thread
            to handle each connection.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header">Relay client requests and server responses</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Directly connect to target web (origin) server:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Extract the “Host: ” header line from the client request message
                to get the target server name
              </li>
              <li>Connect and send the request to target server on port 80</li>
              <li>Get the response and send back to client</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When configured to connect to another proxy server</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Connect and send the request to the specified proxy server and
                port
              </li>
              <li>Get the response and send back to client</li>
            </ul>
          </ol>
          <p class="sub-header">Persistent connections</p>
          <p>
            With persistent connection, the proxy server leaves the connection
            open for serving more requests after handling a request. The server
            closes the connection as per the client instructs or if the timeout
            of idle connection has been reached. In order to let the client
            knows when is the end of a response message, all response messages
            on the persistent connection must have a self-defined message length
            using the Content-Length header field [except for the cases of
            dynamically generated web contents]. As our proxy server, in
            principle, is just a relay server, our proxy server does not need to
            handle that as the Content-Length headers should be generated by the
            origin servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To terminate an idle client connection, the proxy server can simply
            close the TCP connection and the client browser should detect this
            situation automatically. Similarly, a client browser can terminate
            an idle persistent connection by closing the TCP connection; the
            proxy server should detect this situation and should handle this
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header">Support request types</p>
          <p>
            For this programming project, HTTP requests generated by all test
            cases are GET request types. However, of unknown reasons, some
            browsers may generate POST requests under some situations (e.g.,
            Chrome browser).
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header">Caching proxy server</p>
          <p>
            You are not required to implement the caching mechanism in this
            project. That means all requests received from the clients are
            forwarded to the target origin/proxy server without the needs to
            search the cache memory as well as manage the cache memory.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header">How to start the HTTP proxy process</p>
          <p>The http_proxy should be invoked as follow:</p>
          <samp> 
        ./http_proxy myport [proxy_server:port] 

          </samp>
          <p>
            The 1st parameter - myport is the port number that the http_proxy is
            listening on. The 2nd parameter -proxy_server:port is an optional
            argument. When proxy_server:port is specified, all the HTTP requests
            (responses) should be forwarded to (received from) proxy_server. The
            port in proxy_server:port is the port number that the proxy_server
            is listening on.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header">Output messages</p>
          <p>
            To aid your programming and debugging, please print some log
            information to the screen. You are required to generate some output
            with major events:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When receiving a new connection - identify the origin - display
              some useful information.
            </li>
            <li>
              When establishing a new connection - display the target server
              information.
            </li>
            <li>
              When receiving a new request - display some information, e.g,, the
              request-line.
            </li>
            <li>
              When receiving a response message - display some information,
              e.g., message size
            </li>
            <li>
              When detecting the termination of persistent connections or server
              connection.
